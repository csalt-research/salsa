## About The Repository

This repository hosts the artifacts pertaining to our paper [**<samp>SALSA: Speedy ASR-LLM Synchronous Aggregation</samp>**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16542) accepted to ***Interspeech 2024***.

The main contribution of our paper is :mag_right: a simple <samp>LLM stitching technique</samp> that uses a <samp>tokenization agnostic algorithm</samp> to combine the generation capability from *`LLAMA`* and speech comprehension from *`Whisper`*.


## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt](https://github.com/csalt-research/salsa)
cd salsa
```

Install the minimal dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install with all dependencies (including quantization, sentencepiece, tokenizers for Llama models, etc.):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-all.txt
```

Finally, to run the recipes you will also need access to LLAMA weights, which can be obtained here: [https://huggingface.co/meta-llama](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama)


You are all set! ðŸŽ‰

&nbsp;


## Running experiments

Our codebase has a simple, easily customizable wrapper script `run.sh`, that contains the complete experimental setup divided into different stages. To run all stages, simply execute: 

```bash
./run.sh --hf_access_token <huggingface_personal_access_token>
```

(Please see this [blog]([tutorials/finetune_adapter.md](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens)) for details on how to generate a personal access token for hugging face)

To run a specific stage, let's say "dataset creation", you can execute:

```bash
./run.sh --hf_access_token <huggingface_personal_access_token> --stage 1 --stop_stage 1
```

Unfortunately, for datasets other than Fleurs, Commonvoice, and Librispeech, one must modify `data_preparation/dump_dataset_v2.py` and then proceed to run other stages as mentioned above.
